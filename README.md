Virtual Reality for Wind Turbine Application Using Unity 3D and C Sharp

Wind energy lab is a virtual environment where Drexel Engineering students get to simulate dynamic engineering experiments using the wind turbine module consisting of wind turbines, turbine speed monitors, and fans. 

The module objects were created using Unity 3D, and I constructed the code base in C# on Visual Studio Code for the module. The interactive code base of the wind turbine controller and the fan speed allows the students to adjust the fan speed to mimic the amount of wind received from the natural environment, and based on the wind velocity, the speed of the turbines is adjusted according to the computational equations that reflect a range of wind speed in actual wind farms.
